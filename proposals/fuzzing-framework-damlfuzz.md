## Abstract

We propose developing a fuzzer for Daml smart contracts.

Unit testing of Daml code relies on developers writing specific scenarios in Daml Script and asserting expected outcomes. There is no way to automatically generate random sequences of ledger operations, no way to define system-wide invariants, and no way to explore the contract state space beyond the scenarios a developer manually anticipates. Developers are used to tooling that is mature and readily available for languages and development frameworks in other ecosystems (c.f. the Foundry tools for Ethereum), and its absence provides an inferior experience for developers of applications on Canton Network.

The fuzzing tool will provision the first property-based testing and coverage-guided fuzzing framework for Daml smart contracts while being designed from the ground up for Daml's unique authorization model, UTXO-like state, and multi-party privacy semantics. It will be developed as open-source, free to use, executable locally, will integrate with the current Daml tooling, and will provide reports usable in CI/CD pipelines.

## Specification

### 1. Objective

**Problem:** The Daml Standard Library has no random value generation, no `Arbitrary` typeclass, no generator combinators, and no shrinking infrastructure. Daml Script provides only deterministic, manually-authored scenario tests. This means:

- Developers only test scenarios they explicitly think of.
- Edge cases in authorization logic (e.g., what happens when a party is both signatory and observer?) go unexplored.
- Complex multi-step workflows (e.g., DVP settlement with partial allocations, deadline expiry, and concurrent exercises) are tested with at most a handful of scenarios.
- The interactions between CIPs (e.g., CIP-0078 fee removal affecting CIP-0047 reward generation) are never systematically tested.
- CIP-0013 (the re-onboarding minting bug) is a real example of a bug that would have been caught by invariant testing - the invariant "no SV mints more than their agreed share" was violated, but no test checked it under all possible re-onboarding sequences.

The 2026 Canton Developer Experience Survey identified security tooling as "Important" or "Critical" by 75% of respondents.

**Intended Outcome:** Canton Network application developers will receive an easy-to-use fuzzing framework where they can:

1. Define invariants ("the total token supply never changes during transfers").
2. Run automated fuzzing campaigns that generate random sequences of ledger operations.
3. Get minimal failing sequences when an invariant is violated.
4. Use coverage feedback to guide exploration toward untested code paths.

### 2. Implementation Mechanics

We propose DamlFuzz as a **Daml Script extension** with a companion Haskell library. The design will follow the proven architecture of invariant testing tools that developers are used to from the Ethereum ecosystem, adapted for Daml's unique execution model. The work will focus on three main components:

**Component 1 - Generator Framework (`DamlFuzz.Gen`):**

The foundation will be a generator library providing:
- `Gen a` monad for building random value generators
- Built-in generators for all Daml primitive types: `Int`, `Decimal`, `Text`, `Bool`, `Date`, `Time`, `Party`, `ContractId`
- Combinators: `oneOf`, `frequency`, `listOf`, `mapOf`, `optional`, `suchThat`, `resize`, `scale`
- **Automatic derivation** via Template Haskell-style metaprogramming: for any Daml data type defined with `data` or `template`, DamlFuzz will generate an `Arbitrary` instance automatically
- Shrinking: when a failing input is found, DamlFuzz will systematically reduce it to a minimal reproducer

The key technical challenge is that Daml has no `IO` monad and no `System.Random`. DamlFuzz will solve this by providing a **deterministic PRNG** implemented in pure Daml using `Int` arithmetic. The seed will be supplied externally via the test runner (Haskell side), making tests reproducible.

**Component 2 - Property Definition DSL (`DamlFuzz.Property`):**

Developers will define properties using a domain-specific language at three levels:

*Function-level properties* (postconditions on individual choices):
```
-- "After a transfer, the sender's balance decreases by exactly the transfer amount"
prop_transfer_sender_balance : Property
prop_transfer_sender_balance = forAll genTransferArgs $ \(sender, receiver, amount) ->
  let balanceBefore = queryBalance sender
  in after (submit sender (exerciseCmd holdingCid Transfer with ..) ) $
     queryBalance sender === balanceBefore - amount
```

*System-level invariants* (must hold after every operation in a sequence):
```
-- "Total token supply is conserved across all transfers"
invariant_supply_conservation : Invariant
invariant_supply_conservation = Invariant $ do
  holdings <- queryAll @Holding
  let totalSupply = sum [h.amount | h <- holdings]
  totalSupply === expectedTotalSupply
```

*Stateful fuzzing campaigns* (random sequences of operations):
```
campaign_token_stress : Campaign
campaign_token_stress = Campaign
  { actions = [Action "transfer" genTransferAction, Action "allocate" genAllocateAction, ...]
  , invariants = [invariant_supply_conservation, invariant_no_negative_balances]
  , actors = [alice, bob, charlie, bank]
  , depth = 50        -- max actions per sequence
  , runs = 1000       -- number of random sequences
  }
```

**Component 3 - Fuzzing Engine (`DamlFuzz.Engine`):**

The engine will orchestrate fuzzing campaigns:

1. **Initialization:** Deploy contracts under test, set up initial state
2. **Sequence generation:** For each run, generate a random sequence of up to `depth` actions:
   - Select a random action type from the campaign's action list (weighted by `frequency`)
   - Select a random actor from the actor pool
   - Generate random arguments using the action's generator
   - Submit the action via Daml Script's `submit` / `trySubmit`
3. **Invariant checking:** After each successful action, evaluate all invariants. If any invariant returns `False`, record the failing sequence.
4. **Coverage guidance** (optional, enhanced by DamlCov): If DamlCov is available, after each action, check which new code paths were covered and prioritize action types and argument ranges that increase coverage. Coverage-guided fuzzing finds deeper bugs faster. DamlFuzz is fully functional without DamlCov. Coverage guidance is an enhancement, not a requirement.
5. **Shrinking:** When a violation is found, systematically reduce the sequence:
   - Remove actions that do not affect the violation
   - Shrink action arguments to smaller values
   - Report the minimal failing sequence

The engine will run as a Haskell executable that invokes Daml Script programmatically, managing the PRNG state and coverage feedback externally while the Daml code handles ledger operations.

#### Interaction with Existing Daml Toolchain

| Daml Tool | Integration Point |
|-----------|-------------------|
| `dpm test` | DamlFuzz campaigns run via `dpm test` as standard Daml Script tests |
| Daml Script | DamlFuzz uses `submit`, `trySubmit`, `query`, `allocateParty` - all standard Daml Script APIs |
| `dpm build` | DamlFuzz is a `.dar` dependency added to `daml.yaml` |
| DPM | Installable via `dpm install` as a vendored `.dar` |

### 3. Architectural Alignment

The 2026 Canton Developer Experience Survey identified security tooling as "Important" or "Critical" by 75% of respondents, yet the current tooling support for fuzzing in Daml is insufficient. Beyond the use during the SDL of every project building for Canton Network, we list several use cases where the tool is applicable to CIPs and projects that are of interest to the overall Canton ecosystem:

- **CIP-0056 (Token Standard):** This CIP could benefit from a reusable library that includes pre-built invariants such as supply conservation, non-negative balances, transfer atomicity, and allocation lock exclusivity. Any project implementing CIP-0056 tokens will inherit these properties by adding DamlFuzz as a dependency.
- **CIP-0104 (Traffic-Based App Rewards):** The complex traffic attribution formula is a good fuzzing target - integer overflow, multi-app splitting fairness, and coupon threshold semantics can all be expressed as invariants and stress-tested with random traffic patterns.
- **CIP-0013 (Re-onboarding Bug):** One could write a property that would have caught this bug ("SV minting never exceeds agreed share after any sequence of onboarding/removal/re-onboarding").
- **CIP-0105 (SV Locking):** Tier determination and vesting calculations under random lock/unlock sequences are natural fuzzing targets.

### Named Ecosystem Adopters
This section lists the ecosystem adopters who expressed interest in adopting and using DamlFuzz. It will be periodically updated as we gather additional support.

- Quantstamp (audit provider): DamlFuzz will be used to discover invariant violations in client audits.
- Coinversaa (project on Canton): DamlFuzz will be used to strengthen the test suite.


### 4. Backward Compatibility

No backward compatibility impact. DamlFuzz will be a library (`.dar` package) and a companion Haskell executable. It will use only public Daml Script APIs and will not modify the Daml compiler, SDK, or Canton node software. Projects will opt in by adding DamlFuzz as a test dependency.

### Milestone 4: Ongoing Maintenance
- **Estimated Delivery:** Ongoing for 12 month after delivering Milestone 2
- **Focus:** The team commits to maintaining the tool and providing developer support for 12 months following the completion. The code will be maintained as an open-source project during the entire duration. The team is interested in providing long-term support for the tool even after the initial commitment window elapses. In laymen terms, the team will ensure that the tool is ready and safe to use out of the box, actively maintain the repository during this period, and provide developer support for the ecosystem. This will include:
  - Bugfixes
  - Security updates - critical with the dependency supply chain attack 
  - Canton SDK compatibility
  - Major platform compatibility
  - Github ticket responses and developer support
  - Feature request triage
  - Additional feature development as feasible

Note that DamlFuzz will continue being usable even after funding period. The proposed tool is a standalone library and executable on top of stable Daml Script APIs and Daml-LF protobuf, so it will continue to work against any Daml version that does not break Script API contracts. All materials including `.dars` and tutorials will remain published, and the repository will remain open for community PRs and open-source development. The implementers are interested in ongoing maintenance of the tool beyond the indicated period.

  - Ongoing maintenance of the project
  - Number of (un)resolved developer support tickets in Github

### Milestone 5: Ecosystem Adoption
- **Estimated Delivery:** Ongoing for 12 month after delivering Milestone 2
- **Focus:** The team will focus on supporting ecosystem projects and other ecosystem participants in integrating DamlFuzz to improve the security posture of their code. This is an event-based milestone that aligns the grant and the proposed tool with the ecosystem adoption. We request 100,000 CC/project using the DamlFuzz, as demonstrated by their repository or an external audit report. The events will count within the first 12 months of the tool becoming usable, and the payouts will be limited to such 10 events (that is 1,000,000 CC milestone cap).
- **Deliverables / Value Metrics:**
  - Number of projects integrating DamlFuzz

---

## Go-to-Market Strategy

DamlFuzz will be released as an open-source, freely available tool. The strategy for driving adoption is built around Quantstamp's existing position within the Canton security and audit community and does not depend on paid promotion or platform exclusivity.

**Distribution**

The tool will be published to a public GitHub repository under an open-source license and made available via DPM as an installable package (`dpm install damlfuzz`). All source code, documentation, and release artifacts will be freely accessible from day one.

**Tutorial-Driven Onboarding**

Step-by-step tutorials will be published covering: writing a first DamlFuzz property, and integrating the tool into a CI/CD pipeline. Tutorials will be written against real Canton Network packages (Daml Finance, Splice reference implementations) to ensure developers encounter immediately applicable examples. Tutorials will be submitted for inclusion in the official Digital Asset documentation and Canton Network developer hub.

**Audit-Integrated Recommendation**

Quantstamp conducts security audits of Daml and Canton Network applications. DamlFuzz will be recommended as a standard part of every Daml audit engagement: DamlFuzz will be used to demonstrate invariant violations where applicable. This gives the tool immediate credibility through use in real security contexts and ensures every project that undergoes a Quantstamp audit is exposed to the tooling.

**Community Evangelism**

Quantstamp will evangelize the tool through the Canton Network security community via developer forums, ecosystem calls, and technical meetups. Canton Network security experts are the natural early adopters: once they incorporate fuzzing into their standard workflow, they raise the baseline expectation for every project they review, contribute to, or audit. The goal is for DamlFuzz to become an expected artifact of serious Daml development - the way `forge fuzz` is expected in serious Solidity development.

**Definition of Success**

The primary success metric is adoption: Daml developers are routinely performing fuzz testing as part of their standard development and pre-deployment process, and the security posture of Canton Network applications improves as a result. The secondary metric is ecosystem position: when a Daml developer wants to fuzz-test a contract, DamlFuzz is the first solution they reach for. A concrete marker of success is that DamlFuzz appears in the testing sections of community audit checklists, CIP security guidance, and onboarding documentation for Canton Network developers.

---

## Motivation

Today, Daml developers ship contracts with structurally inadequate test assurance. There is no random input generation, no invariant checking, no way to ask "does this property hold for all possible sequences of operations?" This gap is not hypothetical. CIP-0013, the re-onboarding minting bug, is a documented instance of exactly the kind of invariant violation - "an SV never mints more than its agreed share" - that systematic fuzzing would have surfaced before deployment.

Every major competing smart contract platform has addressed this gap. Foundry (`forge fuzz`) has become a foundational part of the Ethereum developer experience. Daml's absence from this category is conspicuous and is reflected in survey data: 75% of respondents to the 2026 Canton Developer Experience Survey rated security tooling as "Important" or "Critical," while the current tooling provides no automated adversarial testing.

The immediate beneficiaries are the developers building on Canton Network today - those implementing CIP-0056 token standards, building dApps under CIP-0103, or contributing to shared infrastructure like Daml Finance. The strategic beneficiary is the Canton Network itself: a platform that can credibly claim production-quality security tooling attracts more sophisticated builders and more institutional adopters. Developer tooling is infrastructure, and like all infrastructure, its absence is most visible when something breaks.

Notes: 
- Prior fuzzing work in other ecosystems validates the approach and the need, but is not reusable here---Daml's authorization model, UTXO-like state, and multi-party privacy semantics require a redesign. The funding covers the Daml-specific engineering. (b)
- We received verbal confirmation that there is no overlapping work at Digital Assets.

## Rationale

The proposed tooling exists in many mature ecosystems. The proposal follows the established use cases and patterns. The team has rich experience with developing similar tools, and formulated the roadmap based on their experience.

## Appendix: Responses to Reviews

In response to the [review](https://github.com/canton-foundation/canton-dev-fund/pull/52#issuecomment-4128467271):

### 1. Evidence of ecosystem demand

Quantstamp has conducted multiple security audits of Daml and Canton Network applications. In each engagement, the absence of automated invariant testing is a recurring friction point, both for our auditors and for the development teams we work with. We regularly report untested code, and we regularly report untested edge cases to Canton Network projects being audited. Audited projects also often seek guidance regarding testing from auditors, which we are unable to provide due to the tooling absence. The 2026 Canton Developer Experience Survey cited in the proposal, where 75% of respondents rated this category of tooling as "Important" or "Critical". We can obtain further evidence through direct testimonials from Canton Network projects to the committee.

The proposed tool plays an important role for agentic development as well. It provides data that agents can use to reason about their code quality, guide to to finding mishandled logic, and delivering more reliable code. The use of AI tooling during development is increasingly popular, making the tool even more valuable ecosystem addition.

### 2. Scope and sequencing

The delivery sequence already ensures independent value at each stage. DamlFuzz is designed to be independently useful from Milestone 2 onward.

### 3. Adoption expectations

The team will consider the tool successful if it:

- Becomes universally recommended as a fuzzing tool by the Canton Network and Daml community.
- A vast majority of projects completing their development phase enters the audit phase with DamlFuzz configured in the codebase.
- Multiple auditing firms recommend the use of DamlFuzz when providing guidance to projects undergoing an audit.
- DamlFuzz is used in CIP implementations (e.g. in CIP-0056).
- Becomes regularly used by agents when developing DAML code.

### 4. Integration with existing workflows

DamlFuzz uses only standard Daml Script APIs. Campaigns are expressed in Daml Script and run via `dpm test`, so they appear in the same test execution workflow developers already use. Adding DamlFuzz to a project **only requires adding it as a test dependency** in `daml.yaml` and writing campaign definitions.

The tool will be executable locally, and its structured plain text output can be further used in CI/CD pipelines as is customary for other similar tools.
